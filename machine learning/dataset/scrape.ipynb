Trapped in the capital, they have no way of escape. <br/><br/>But rumours abound of a league of young English gentlemen who are risking their lives to spirit French aristocrats away to safety across the Channel. Led by a man known only as the \\'Scarlet Pimpernel\\', they leave no trace behind them save a single note. <br/><br/>Determined to stop them, ruthless spymaster Chauvelin travels to England and embarks on a quest to uncover the identity of their leader, forcing the Scarlet Pimpernel and his men to summon all their courage and wits to evade capture and stay alive.<br/><br/><b>PRAISE FOR <i>THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL</i></b><br/><br/>\"Anyone who feels that their outward manner is but a travesty of their inner self can hardly fail to respond to THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL\" - <i>Independent</i><br/><br/>\"The Baroness Orczy invented the \"masked avenger\" genre of fiction - the swashbuckling hero of dual identity.
